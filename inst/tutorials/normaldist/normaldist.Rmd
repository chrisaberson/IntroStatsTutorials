# Normal Distribution and Probabilities 

## Overview

This tutorial focuses on the normal distribution, z-scores, areas under the distribution curve, and probability basics. 

The PowerPoint slides for the presentation in the videos are on Canvas if you want a copy.

The videos (as well as others) can also be found on my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5kDZTyHZlgSgSEa3YQXOig 

### Learning Objectives

Learning Objectives:

Calculate normal curve areas and percentiles using R

Use normal distribution areas to estimate vales

Describe the prevalence of the normal distribution

Calculate basic probability values

Apply probability concepts to data-based problems

## Packages 

This tutorial uses the following packages:

* `learnr` and `shiny` and `rmarkdown` for aspects of the tutorial

These packages should be automatically loaded within this tutorial (but you already installed `learnr` if you are here). If you are working outside of this tutorial (e.g., working with the data files and trying analysis in R) then you need to make sure that the necessary packages are installed on your computer.

## Video 3 Getting area with R

![](https://youtu.be/ciaGApJoeg4)

## Exercise: Area with R

The code below uses the **pnorm** command to calculate the area associated with a specific z-score. The command below does this for a z = 1. There are three useful things we can do with this code. The command below tells us the area at or below 1.0. 

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r ECHO=T, EVAL=T}
pnorm(1)
```

Sometimes we want the area at or above a certain point. This version of the code yields that by simply subtracting the total area (always 1) from the area at or below 1.0. What remains is the area at or above 1.0.

```{r EVAL=T, ECHO=TRUE}
1-pnorm(1)
```

Finally, we sometimes want to get the area between a value and the mean (0). Note that this is the same as 1-pnorm(1)-.50.


```{r ECHO=T, EVAL=T}
pnorm(1)-pnorm(0)
```


In a class exam with a M = 10 and s = 4, your instructor sets the A at a score of 15. What proportion of students would get an A? Adapt the appropriate code from above to answer. 

$\huge z=\frac{x-\bar{x}}{s}$

```{r ex2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 1}

```

```{r ex2-solution}
1-pnorm(1.25)
```

![](https://youtu.be/ydYi4PRfhn4)

## z score practice

Imagine you took an intelligence test online. The test reports the following information: scores range from 0 to 240; the mean score is 100 with a standard deviation of 15; scores are normally distributed. The test authors report the following categories for scores

130 and higher = Extremely smart  
115-130 = Smart  
85-115 	= Average  
70-85  	= Not so smart  
70 and below = Extremely not smart  

Use the space below to perform calculations (using **pnorm**) to answer the quiz questions. 

$\huge z=\frac{x-\bar{x}}{s}$

```{r ex3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 1}

```

```{r quiz4, ECHO=F}

    learnr::answer(".1587", correct = TRUE),
    learnr::answer(".8413"),
    learnr::answer(".50"),
    learnr::answer("None"),
    correct = "Correct! This would correspond to all of the scores at 85 and below. 85 corresponds to a z of -1. pnorm(-1) gives the area at or below 85.",
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = T
  ),
  learnr::question("What proportion are Average?" ,
