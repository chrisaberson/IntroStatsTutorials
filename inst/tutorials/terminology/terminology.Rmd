# Terminology

## Overview

This tutorial focuses on basic terminology and serves as an introduciton to the class. The tutorial includes a combination of videos, text, and knowledge check quizzes. As we move to more complex topics, tutorials will also included oppportunities to run R code. 

The PowerPoint slides for the presentation in the videos are on Canvas if you want a standalone copy. 

The videos (as well as others) can also be found on my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5kDZTyHZlgSgSEa3YQXOig 

For several tutorials in this module, we will use a data set called *denial*, this datafile includes variables that examine relationships between climate denial and a variety of other beliefs. The *denial* data come from:

Jylh√§, K. M., & Hellmer, K. (in press). Right-wing populism and climate change denial: The roles of exclusionary and anti-egalitarian preferences, conservative ideology, and antiestablishment attitudes. *Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy*. https://doi.org/10.1111/asap.12203

We won't analyze any data in this tutorial but will in both the Data Visualization and the Central Tendency and Dispersion tutorials. 

### Learning Objectives

List different types of variables

Describe differences between variable types

Apply the different variable definitions to novel variables (i.e., new ones you haven't seen before)

Distinguish between variable types, population vs. sample, and descriptive vs. inferential statistic

## Video 3: Types of Variables

## Quiz 3

The dataset called *denial* includes variable called **Gender** and **CCD** (Climate change denial). The gender variables includes 3 categories (1=Male, 2 = Female, 3 = Transgender) the climate change denial variable is the sum of a series of questions measured on scale that ranges from 1 to 5 (Where higher scores indicate more endorsement of climate change denial).


```{r quiz3, ECHO=F}
learnr::quiz(
  learnr::question("What type of variable is **Gender**",
    learnr::answer("Ordinal"),
    learnr::answer("Interval/Ratio"),
    learnr::answer("Nominal", correct = TRUE),
    learnr::answer("None of the above"),
    correct = "Correct! In this case the numbers simply represent a category name that could be placed in any order.",
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = T
  ),
  learnr::question("What type of variable is **CCD**",
    learnr::answer("Ordinal"),
    learnr::answer("Interval/Ratio", correct = TRUE),
    learnr::answer("Nominal"),
    learnr::answer("None of the above"),
    correct = "Correct! In this case the numbers a scale where higher means more and lower means less and well as having mathematical properties.",
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",

    learnr::answer("Count variables"),
    learnr::answer("None of the above"),
