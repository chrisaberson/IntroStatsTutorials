# t-tests

## Overview

This tutorial focuses on three forms of the t-test, one of the real workhorse statistics in psychology. We will introduce the one sample t first then move to the more common applications - independent and paired samples. 

The PowerPoint slides for the presentation in the videos are on Canvas if you want a standalone copy. 

The videos (as well as others) can also be found on my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5kDZTyHZlgSgSEa3YQXOi

### Learning Objectives

Identify the three forms of t-test

Explain the conditions for applying each t-test

Compute 95% confidence intervals and t-tests

Given a problem, define the null and alternative hypotheses

Apply the above procedures to making decisions about null hypotheses

Describe and calculate Cohen's d as a measure of effect size

## Data

*denial* is the datafile used in exercises. These data examine relationships between climate denial and a variety of other beliefs. 

JylhÃ¤, K. M., & Hellmer, K. (in press). Right-wing populism and climate change denial: The roles of exclusionary and anti-egalitarian preferences, conservative ideology, and antiestablishment attitudes. *Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy*. https://doi.org/10.1111/asap.12203

The datafile includes the variables **CCD** (Climate Change denial), **ANTIESTABL** (Anti Establishment Beliefs), **EXCL_ANTIEG** (anti egalitarian preferences), **TRADVALUE** (traditional values), **OPENNESS** (openness to new experiences), **PSEUDOSCI** (pseudoscience beliefs), and **AGREEABL** (agreeableness), **AGE** (age in years), **Gender** (three categories), **Education** (5 categories, and **ed** (education split into college grads vs. non grads)

*yoga* is a datafile with two variables that pre-intervention depression (**preBDI**) to post-intervention depression (**postBDI**). These data represent a test of the effectiveness of yoga on veteran's depression.

### Packages 

This tutorial uses the following new packages:

* `lsr` for effect sizes
* `BayesFactor` for Bayes Factors

## Video V Examples from the literature


![](https://youtu.be/r12J7R6JdD4)

## Exercise

The following examples use the *denial2* data. To facilitate t-test, I have removed transgendered people from these data as there are two few to analyze. 

The code for the independent samples t places the dependent variable (the variable that is interval/ratio) on the left and the dichotomous variable on the right. The code is largely identical to the format we used for regression. 

```{r}
t.test(denial2$CCD~denial2$Gender)
```

The *lsr* package computes a variety of effect sizes. The format is similar to the t-test but the command is different. This is the first time we've used a package. The lsr:: piece lets R know you are using something from a package. CohensD is the command.  

```{r}
lsr::cohensD(denial2$CCD~denial2$Gender)
```


Run a t-test comparing climate change denial **CCD** for those with and without college educations **ed**. Obtain an effect size for the relationship. 

```{r ex1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}

```

```{r ex1-solution}
t.test(denial2$CCD~denial2$ed)
lsr::cohensD(denial2$CCD~denial2$ed)
```

## Quiz 5

```{r}
t.test(denial2$CCD~denial2$ed)
lsr::cohensD(denial2$CCD~denial2$ed)
```

The following questions refer to the analyses you just ran. Results are reproduced above for your convenience. 

```{r quiz6, ECHO=F}
learnr::quiz(
  learnr::question("What is the null hypothesis?",
    learnr::answer(sprintf("$\\mu_1-\\mu_2=0$"), correct = TRUE),
    learnr::answer(sprintf("$\\mu_1-\\mu_2\\neq0$")),
    learnr::answer(sprintf("$\\mu=0$")),
    learnr::answer("none of these"),
    correct = "Correct!",
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,

    learnr::answer("Reject the null"),
    learnr::answer("Accept the null"),
    learnr::answer("It is wrong"),
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = T
  )
 ,
 learnr::question("The best plain English conclusion here would be",
    learnr::answer("We have no evidence that education is related to climate change denial", correct = TRUE),
    learnr::answer("More educated people show more climate change denial"),

## Video VI Paired Samples t-test

## Quiz 

```{r quiz7, ECHO=F}

  learnr::question("In the context of the t-test, 'paired' means",
    learnr::answer("The same people measured twice", correct = TRUE),
    learnr::answer("join or connect"),
    learnr::answer("Different people measured in different conditions"),
    learnr::answer("Different people measured in one condition"),

## Exercise 

```{r echo=FALSE}
pre<-c(3,4,5,6,7,9)
post<-c(6,5,7,8,9,10)
pairedex<-as.data.frame(cbind(pre,post))
```

The following example uses a small dataset called *pairedex* to show the format of paired t analysis. The big difference between independent and paired t code is that paired uses a , in place of the ~ . 

```{r}
t.test(pairedex$pre,pairedex$post)
lsr::cohensD(pairedex$pre,pairedex$post)
```

Using the data called *yoga*, perform a t-test comparing pre-intervention depression (**preBDI**) to post-intervention depression (**postBDI**).

```{r ex2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}

```

```{r ex2-solution}

Adapt the code above to run a Bayes Factor for predicting climate change denial (**CCD**) from education (**ed**).

```{r ex3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 1}
