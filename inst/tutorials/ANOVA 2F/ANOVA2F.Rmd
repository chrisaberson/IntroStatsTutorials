# Two Factor ANOVA

## Overview

This tutorial focuses on the two factor ANOVA with a particular emphasis on interpreting interactions. The tutorial also includes a brief section on NHST with correlation/regression designs. 

The PowerPoint slides for the presentation in the videos are on Canvas if you want a standalone copy. 

The videos (as well as others) can also be found on my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5kDZTyHZlgSgSEa3YQXOi

### Learning Objectives

Define the different types of Sums of Square in the two factor context

Explain the conditions for applying the Two Factor ANOVA

Compute Sums of Squares, degrees of freedom, Mean Square, and F

Given a problem, define the null and alternative hypotheses

Apply the above procedures to making decisions about null hypotheses

Describe and calculate partial eta-squared as a measure of effect size

Graph and interpret interaction effects 

Use R to compute ANOVA and eta-squared

Excitedly tell your parents about interaction effects

Define and perform analyses testing hypothesis in correlation/regression 

## Data

*denial2* is the datafile used in exercises. These data examine relationships between climate denial and a variety of other beliefs. 

Jylh√§, K. M., & Hellmer, K. (in press). Right-wing populism and climate change denial: The roles of exclusionary and anti-egalitarian preferences, conservative ideology, and antiestablishment attitudes. *Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy*. https://doi.org/10.1111/asap.12203

The datafile includes the variables **CCD** (Climate Change denial), **ANTIESTABL** (Anti Establishment Beliefs), **EXCL_ANTIEG** (anti egalitarian preferences), **TRADVALUE** (traditional values), **OPENNESS** (openness to new experiences), **PSEUDOSCI** (pseudoscience beliefs), and **AGREEABL** (agreeableness), **AGE** (age in years), **Gender** (two categories), **Education** (5 categories, and **ed** (education split into college grads vs. non grads)

*culture* is a datafile used in examples. It contains a variable indicating condition (**Condition**), region (**Region**) and one indicating testosterone increase (**Testosterone**).

### Packages 

This tutorial uses the following new packages:

* `lsr` for effect sizes
* `car` for ANOVA computations
* `ggplot2` for graphing

## Video 5: Factorial ANOVA in R 
![](https://youtu.be/0BzC5lOOoDk)

## Factorial ANOVA in R

Factorial ANOVA in R looks a lot like one factor ANOVA, but there is some extra code to get the correct sums of squares. There are numerous types of SS and ways to conduct ANOVA but only one type that is relevant to situations when we test interactions 

```{r}
A<-c("A1","A1","A1","A1","A2","A2","A2","A2")
B<-c("B1","B2","B1","B2","B1","B2","B1","B2")
x<-c(2,4,4,6,8,10,12,14)
xx<-as.data.frame(cbind(A,B,x))
xx$A<-as.factor(xx$A)
xx$B<-as.factor(xx$B)
xx$x<-as.numeric(xx$x)
knitr::kable(xx)
```

The first line of code sets the correct contrast. 

options(contrasts=c("contr.helmert", "contr.poly"))

The second conducts the ANOVA, writing it to an object (anova2F).

anova2F<-lm(Testosterone~Region+Condition+Region:Condition, data=culture)

The third line uses the `car` package to produce the correct sums of squares. 

car::Anova(anova2F, type = 3)



```{r}
options(contrasts=c("contr.helmert", "contr.poly"))
anova2F<-lm(x~A*B, data=xx)
car::Anova(anova2F, type = 3)

```

The final line produces the effect size using `lsr`.

lsr::EtaSquared(anova2F)
```{r}
lsr::etaSquared(anova2F)
```

## Exercise 

Using the *denial2* data, predict Anti-Egalitarian Preferences (**EXCL_ANTIEG**) from **Education** and **Gender**.

```{r ex2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 4}

```

```{r ex2-solution}
options(contrasts=c("contr.helmert", "contr.poly"))
ex2<-lm(EXCL_ANTIEG~Education*Gender, data=denial2)
car::Anova(ex2, type = 3)
lsr::etaSquared(ex2)
```

## Graphing with `ggplot2`

Before we interpret our effects, it is useful to view them graphically. We will use R's most popular graphing package `ggplot2`to accomplish this. The code for `ggplot2` may seem complicated at first, but you can easily adapt it to new problems. 

The first line creates our graphing object. xx represents our data file. aes stands for "aestetics" - this is what will be represented on the x and y axis. x is = one factor, y = outcome variable, fill = the other factor. Generally, fill should be the factor with the fewest levels (not an issue here as they both have two). The second line just defines what we are graphing and does not need to be modified is only needed for the tutorial to make stuff fit on screen)

bars <- ggplot(xx, aes(x=A, y=x, fill=B))
bars + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom="bar", position="dodge")

```{r}
bars <- ggplot(xx, aes(x=A, y=x, fill=B))
bars + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom="bar", position="dodge")
```

### Exercise

Adapt the `ggplot2` code to make a graph for your analysis. 

```{r ex3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 4}

```

```{r ex3-solution}
bars <- ggplot(denial2, aes(x=Education, y=EXCL_ANTIEG, fill=Gender))
bars + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom="bar", position="dodge")+coord_fixed(ratio = 0.5)
```

One thing you might notice is that the labels are overlapping on the x-axis. We can add the command below to our code to fix that. 

+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))

give it a shot below

```{r ex4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 4}

```

```{r ex4-solution}
bars <- ggplot(denial2, aes(x=Education, y=EXCL_ANTIEG, fill=Gender))
bars + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom="bar", position="dodge") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))+coord_fixed(ratio = 0.5)
```

### Descriptive Statistics

One last useful piece are descriptive statistics. As before the tapply command can deliver those 

```{r}
tapply(xx$x, list(xx$A,xx$B),mean)
tapply(xx$x, list(xx$A,xx$B),sd)
```

Adapt the code above to produce descriptive statistics for your analyses.

```{r ex5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}

```

```{r ex5-solution}
tapply(denial2$EXCL_ANTIEG,list(denial2$Gender,denial2$Education),mean)
tapply(denial2$EXCL_ANTIEG,list(denial2$Gender,denial2$Education),sd)
```

## Quiz

```{r}
options(contrasts=c("contr.helmert", "contr.poly"))
ex2<-lm(EXCL_ANTIEG~Education*Gender, data=denial2)

bars <- ggplot(denial2, aes(x=Education, y=EXCL_ANTIEG, fill=Gender))

## APA Style Write-up

In this section we will review how to present findings in APA style. 

```{r}
options(contrasts=c("contr.helmert", "contr.poly"))
ex2<-lm(EXCL_ANTIEG~Education*Gender, data=denial2)
car::Anova(ex2, type = 3)
lsr::etaSquared(ex2)
tapply(denial2$EXCL_ANTIEG,list(denial2$Gender,denial2$Education),mean)
tapply(denial2$EXCL_ANTIEG,list(denial2$Gender,denial2$Education),sd)
tapply(denial2$EXCL_ANTIEG,denial2$Gender,mean)
tapply(denial2$EXCL_ANTIEG,denial2$Gender,sd)
tapply(denial2$EXCL_ANTIEG,denial2$Education,mean)
tapply(denial2$EXCL_ANTIEG,denial2$Education,sd)
```

```{r}

```


A 5x2 between subjects ANOVA examined the relationship between education and gender on anti-egalitarian beliefs. Men (*M* = 1.93, *S* = 0.83) were more likely to endorse anti-egalitarian beliefs than women (*M* = 1.54, *S* = 0.62), *F*(1,1540)=17.06, *p*<.001, partial $\eta^2$ = .066. Education tended to reduce anti-egalitarian beliefs, *F*(4,1540)=4.34,*p*=.002, partial $\eta^2$ = .010. Those without a high school education (*M*=1.75, *S*=.069) and three years after high school (*M*=1.72, *S*=.069) produced similar means. Those with less than four years after high school (*M*=1.61, *S*=.069), and four or more years after high school (*M*=1.60, *S*=.065) indicated lessened endorsement whereas those with doctoral degrees,(*M*=1.44, *S*=.042) indicated the least endorsement of anti-egalitarian beliefs. 

These findings are qualified by a significant interaction wherein men at all levels of education, except the doctoral level, endorsed greater anti egalitarian beliefs, *F*(1,1540)=3.36, *p*=.010, partial $\eta^2$ = .009. (Note: I would likely add a table here with the means or present the graph as well)
