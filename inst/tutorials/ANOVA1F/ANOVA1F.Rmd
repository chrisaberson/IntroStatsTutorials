# One Factor ANOVA

## Overview

This tutorial focuses on the one factor ANOVA. 

The PowerPoint slides for the presentation in the videos are on Canvas if you want a standalone copy. 

The videos (as well as others) can also be found on my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5kDZTyHZlgSgSEa3YQXOi

### Learning Objectives

Define between subjects and within subjects

Explain the conditions for applying the One Factor ANOVA

Compute Sums of Squares, degrees of freedom, Mean Square, and F

Given a problem, define the null and alternative hypotheses

Apply the above procedures to making decisions about null hypotheses

Describe and calculate eta-squared as a measure of effect size

Understand the equivalence of ANOVA and linear regression

Use R to compute ANOVA and eta-squared

Tell all your friends about Sums of Squares

## Data

*denial* is the datafile used in exercises. These data examine relationships between climate denial and a variety of other beliefs. 

Jylh√§, K. M., & Hellmer, K. (in press). Right-wing populism and climate change denial: The roles of exclusionary and anti-egalitarian preferences, conservative ideology, and antiestablishment attitudes. *Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy*. https://doi.org/10.1111/asap.12203

The datafile includes the variables **CCD** (Climate Change denial), **ANTIESTABL** (Anti Establishment Beliefs), **EXCL_ANTIEG** (anti egalitarian preferences), **TRADVALUE** (traditional values), **OPENNESS** (openness to new experiences), **PSEUDOSCI** (pseudoscience beliefs), and **AGREEABL** (agreeableness), **AGE** (age in years), **Gender** (three categories), **Education** (5 categories, and **ed** (education split into college grads vs. non grads)

*condom* is a datafile used in examples. It contains a variable indicating condition (**CONDITIO**) and one indicating number of condoms purchased (**CONDOM**).

### Packages 

This tutorial uses the following new packages:

* `lsr` for effect sizes
* `car` for ANOVA computations

## Video 5: One Factor ANOVA in R

![](https://youtu.be/pa0MZkZXXms)

## Exercise 4

The code below demonstrates how to run a one factor ANOVA using a dataset called *xx* with variables *group* and *x*. These are the values you used earlier for hand calculations. The first command runs the ANOVA and captures it in an object called ex1. The `lsr::etasquared` command uses the object that holds the ANOVA results.

(Note: `lsr` is fussy. If the variables are not factor and numeric, you will get an error)

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
ex1<-aov(xx$x~xx$group)
summary(ex1)
lsr::etaSquared(ex1)
```

### Exercise

Using the *denial2* data, examine climate change denial (**CCD**) by education (**Education**). Be sure to get an effect size.

```{r ex1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

```{r ex1-solution}
ex1<-aov(denial2$CCD~denial2$Education)
summary(ex1)
lsr::etaSquared(ex1)
```

## Quiz
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ex1<-aov(denial2$CCD~denial2$Education)
summary(ex1)
lsr::etaSquared(ex1)
```


```{r quiz6, ECHO=F}
learnr::quiz(
  learnr::question("What is your conclusion about the null hypothesis based on these results? ",
    learnr::answer("Reject"),
    learnr::answer("Accept"),
    learnr::answer("Fail to Reject", correct = TRUE),
    learnr::answer("To little information to decide"),  
    correct = "Correct!" ,
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = T
),
  learnr::question("What does this conclusion mean in plain English",
    learnr::answer("More educated people show less climate change denial"),
    learnr::answer("Education does not seem to be related to climate change denial", correct = TRUE),
    learnr::answer("More educated people deny climate change more"),
    learnr::answer("Climate change is not real"),
    correct = "Correct!",
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = T
  )
