# Central Tendency and Dispersion

## Overview

This tutorial focuses on central tendency and dispersion, two measures used to describe variables numerically. The tutorial includes a combination of videos, text, knowledge check quizzes, and exercises. 

The PowerPoint slides for the presentation in the videos are on Canvas if you want a copy. For those not enrolled in my class, these files can be found here: https://osf.io/9tgxm/ 

The videos (as well as others) can also be found on my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5kDZTyHZlgSgSEa3YQXOig 

### Learning Objectives

* Conduct analyses using R

* Select measures of central tendency appropriate to a variable's level of measurement

* Compare variables in terms of central tendency and dispersion

* Describe information provided by measures of central tendency and dispersion

## Data

All data files exist within this package, so we can simply call them without reference to a file location. 

*denial* is the datafile used in exercises. These data examine relationships between climate denial and a variety of other beliefs. 

Jylh√§, K. M., & Hellmer, K. (in press). Right-wing populism and climate change denial: The roles of exclusionary and anti-egalitarian preferences, conservative ideology, and antiestablishment attitudes. *Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy*. https://doi.org/10.1111/asap.12203

The datafile includes the variables **CCD** (Climate Change denial), **ANTIESTABL** (Anti Establishment Beliefs), **EXCL_ANTIEG** (anti egalitarian preferences), **TRADVALUE** (traditional values), **OPENNESS** (openness to new experiences), **PSEUDOSCI** (pseudoscience beliefs), and **AGREEABL** (agreeableness), **AGE** (age in years), **Gender** (three categories), **Education** (5 categories, and **ed** (education split into college grads vs. non grads)

## Calculation Review

If you had a hard time with the standard deviation calculation, here is a review.

First, set up the problem

$\large s = \sqrt\frac{\Sigma(x-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}=\sqrt\frac{(1-6)^2+(5-6)^2+(6-6)^2+(12-6)^2}{n-1}$

Next do the stuff in the parentheses first. That's the $(x-\bar{x})$ part. 

$\large s = \sqrt\frac{(-5)^2+(-1)^2+(0)^2+(6)^2}{n-1}$

Now, do the exponents (square each value)  and take n-1


$\large s = \sqrt\frac{25+1+0+36}{4-1}$

Add up the numerator


$\large s = \sqrt\frac{62}{4-1}$

Divide numerator by denominator

$\large s = \sqrt{20.67}$

Take the square root

$\large s = 4.55$

## Code: Central Tendency and Standard Deviation

The code below uses the *denial* data to demonstrate how to run analyses.I am using the variable that represents Pseudoscience beliefs. The scale runs from 1-5 with higher scores indicating greater endorsement.

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
mean(denial$PSEUDOSCI)
``` 
The mean command uses the standard format of dataset$variable. Here we see the mean score is relatively low (below the middle point of 3 at least).

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
median(denial$PSEUDOSCI)
``` 

The median a bit lower than the mean suggesting the data are positively skewed.

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
table(denial$PSEUDOSCI)
``` 
There is no mode command but we can use table to get a count of each of the unique values. We can see most people scored a 1. 

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
sd(denial$PSEUDOSCI)
``` 

The standard deviation is 0.88.

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
var(denial$PSEUDOSCI)
``` 

We can even get the variance if we really want it. 


### Exercise 1

For the variable **CCD** (climate change denial), get the mean and standard deviation (2 lines of code)
```{r ex1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}

```

```{r ex1-solution}
mean(denial$CCD)
sd(denial$CCD)
```

    learnr::answer("values substantially higher than most other values in a data set"),
    learnr::answer("the lowest and highest scores in a data set"),
    learnr::answer("extreme or unusual values  ", correct = TRUE),
    learnr::answer("all of the above"),
    correct = "Correct! Outliers are extreme scores.",
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = T
  ),
  learnr::question("The box plot above graphs a variable call agreeableness. What the median score (aproximately)?",
    learnr::answer("3.25"),
    learnr::answer("3.75", correct = TRUE),
    learnr::answer("4.25"),
    learnr::answer("Do not have adequate information"),
    correct = "Correct! The median is where the dark bar in the middle of the box is",
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = T
  ),
  learnr::question("For these data ...",
    learnr::answer("There is one outlier in the lower end of the distribution", correct = TRUE),
    learnr::answer("There is one outlier in the upper end of the distribution"),
    learnr::answer("There are outliers on both ends"),
    learnr::answer("There are no outliers"),
    correct = "Correct.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",
    allow_retry = T
  )
)

``` 


## Exercise Boxplots

```{r ECHO=T, EVAL=T}
boxplot(denial$OPENNESS)
```

The code above creates a boxplot for the **OPENNESS** variable. Use the space below to make a boxplot for **CCD**

```{r ex2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 1}

```

```{r ex2-solution}
boxplot(denial$CCD)
```
