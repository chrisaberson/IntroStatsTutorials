To install the package, use the following code.

    install.packages("devtools")  
    install.packages("learnr")  
    library(devtools)  
    install_github("chrisaberson/IntroStatsTutorials")  

To run a tutorial, use this code..

    library(learnr)  
    library(MVstats)
    run_tutorial("Dataviz", package = "IntroStatsTutorials")

After you run this code, the tutorial will open, either in a separate
RStudio standalone window or in a tab on your browser.

If this doesnâ€™t work, you likely need to update your rtools. Go to
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/</a>
and download the most recent version (for your platform (Note: Rtools is
just for Windows, I am looking into other platforms).
